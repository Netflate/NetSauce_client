# NetSauce Client

This is a small local game made in Godot, just for fun. The code quality is not great as this is merely a fun test project to explore server interactions.

## Game Overview

The game consists of a series of questions. The player who answers first gets the most points, and the rest get fewer points based on how much time has passed since the first player answered.

### Questions

Sure, it's quite obvious that storing images and videos for the questions in the game itself is silly. Logically, this should be done on the server, but I made this game just for fun to play a couple of times with friends and to study how to work with servers in C++. So, the quality of the game was definitely not a priority.
